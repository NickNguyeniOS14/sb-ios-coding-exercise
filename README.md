# Serial Box iOS Coding Exercise
We would like to thank you for taking the time to complete this exercise. We believe this to be an effective and efficient way to allow you to showcase your skills without the pressure of someone watching you. Your code will be used to assist us in deciding if we'd like to proceed further with the interview process. Please understand that completing this exercise in no way guarantees a job or follow-up interview(s). If we choose to move forward in the interview process, we will organize a follow-up interview with you to step through your submission as well as cover a range of technical and social aspects relevant to working at Serial Box. 

We will keep you posted regardless after you have completed and submitted the exercise.

### Overview ###
* This entire exercise can be completed in the provided starter Swift playground and should not take you more than an hour or so to complete. 
* All exercise instructions can be found in the comments at the top of the provided starter playground.  
* All your code should be in **Swift**

### Getting Set UP ##
* **FORK** this repository
* Create a branch named with the following format: `firstName_lastName_ratings`
* Open the provided Swift starter playground and read the exercise instructions
* There is a block of code at the bottom of the playground that is currently commented out. After you write you coded solution to the exercise, you should be able to uncomment this block of code and run the playground to achieve the desired output.

### Submission Instructions
* Complete all tasks as outlined in the comments of the starter playground and create a pull request pointing at **YOUR** fork that contains all your changes.
* Add @kerryknight as a contributor on your fork and tag that account on your PR description when you open the PR.
* If you'd like to include comments to explain your code in any way, please feel free to do so within the code itself or in your PR.

### What we are looking for? ##
Keep it simple. Read the requirements and restrictions carefully and focus on solving the problem.

Treat this playground code like production code. That is, develop your solution in the same way that you would for any code that is intended to be deployed to production. This may be a toy exercise, but we really would like to get an idea of how you write code on a day-to-day basis.
